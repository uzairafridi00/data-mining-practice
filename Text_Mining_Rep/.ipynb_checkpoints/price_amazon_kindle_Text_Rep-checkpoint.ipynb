costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n Books are retardedly pricey .\\n Should have been priced at $250  .\\n Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying

avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n I'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .\\n2, Book Selection & price,  I made a list of 20 books .\\n Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !\\nWhen the original Kindle was released, I was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .\\n It was obviously out of my price range .\\n One, for what you get it is over priced .\\nLast I would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product .\\nThe price, tag for this item is quite steep when you first look at it .\\n I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .\\n Turns out some of them were the same price, while others were much cheaper for the Kindle .\\n she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .\\n I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .\\n Ultimately, I end up paying full price and have for many years .\\n About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .\\n I can download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .\\nBooks are priced in US$ for oversea consumers .\\n99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle .\\n Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases .\\n If Amazon reduces their prices back to the $9

.\\n Even the price doesn't bother me .\\n In addition, you can sort the Kindle books by price and find many more free books .\\n Reading is something that I absolutely love, but I find it hard to wait several days for a book to be shipped to me or pay the outrageous prices at a bookstore .\\nI would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .\\n I must say that I am shocked at how many of these  reviews  are one stars given by people complaining about the price but dont even own a Kindle !\\n There are many other ways such as mp3 players, portable
